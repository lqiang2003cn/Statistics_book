# Modern Statistics: Intuition, Math, Python, R

## Hello friends!

I've been working on a statistics textbook for over a year, and it's now published!

The book contains 19 chapters, 690 pages, 200k words, 390 figures, 45,000 lines of code, and 150 exercises.

You can see the table of contents via the amazon book preview (link below) or the _TOC.pdf file uploaded here.

This repository contains all the code files (Python and R) to produce all the figures in the book, illustrate all the concepts, run the simulations, and show solutions to all exercises.

Please enjoy the sample chapter on t-tests.

## Listen to the audio version (free!)
I have read the entire book out loud. You can listen to it on the go, while reading along (e.g., if English isn't your native language), or to help you fall asleep at night.

You can access the audio version via any of the commonly used podcast apps. You can also use these direct links:
